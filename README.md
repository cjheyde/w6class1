# This Project is to be an example to the Students as a homework for Week 6 - Class 1

The homework is to create your first React Project with the commands:

Navigate into the project directory:

    cd yourProjectName

Start the development server (it opens the browser)

    npm start

Requirements for beginners (100 points here):
- Include one functional component in a separate file, (25 points)
- Include one class component in another file, (25 points)
- Import and use your new componentes in App.js, (25 points)
- Style with App.css. (25 points)

Requirements for advanced students (no points here, but from * to ***):
- Create a Footer.js component and import it into App.js. (*)
- Translate some of the code from your current website (P2P) into react components, (**)
<!-- link for React Styled Component in useful links list -->
- Use React Styled Components to style your site  (***)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
